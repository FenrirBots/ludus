My attempt as beating [Ludus](https://github.com/0xGotcha/Ludus)

### TODO
- Add the WTFPL license.
- Bypass detection methods 3-14.
- Get a copy of OllyDbg or modify Ludus to check for ida in method 4 (CheckWindowClassName).
- Switch from MessageBox to something thats less annoying.
- Create a helper function that creates a MinHook Hook to reduce the amount of duplicate code.
- Move the hook functions from startup.c to their respective files.
